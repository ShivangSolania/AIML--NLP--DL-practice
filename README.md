# 🤖 AI/ML Playground

This repo is where I practice **Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning**.  
You'll find Jupyter notebooks (`.ipynb`) and datasets (`.csv`) that I use to learn, experiment, and test ideas.  

## 📂 What’s inside?
- Data exploration & visualization (EDA)  
- ML model building & training  
- From-scratch implementations + library-based approaches  
- Random experiments with datasets  

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Python  
- NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib 
- Scikit-learn (and more as I go)

Just a learning space, feel free to explore or try out the notebooks yourself 🚀
